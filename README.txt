This project explores ways of devising (and of course implementing)
algorithms that model crystal aggregates for computer graphics. The

This branch primarily focuses on understanding and recreating what is considered 
"double refraction" of amethyst crystals. The choice to use raytracing for this branch
stemmed from circumstance, as well as easier methodologies of actually calculating and
observing birefringence.

The ray tracers RT1, RT2, and RT3 are currently the main raytracers of this branch of this
project. They are meant to be viewed, read through, and used in sequential order.
Further tracers will also follow this sequential logic.
